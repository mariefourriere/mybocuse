# Introduction

Part of our becode training, we had to create a website. Here is the main instruction given:

>You have been selected to make a working prototype for the new cooking bootcamp of the Paul Bocuse Academy ("In Bocuse we trust"), a 7-months intensive cooking training with some of the best chefs around the world.
>One part of the training consists of a daily activity called "The Recette", each day at 1:30PM a learner choses one of his favorite recipe and shares it with the rest of the class.

```git
git init

```
### Management
We used [Trello](https://trello.com/b/tKILIBwr/mybocus) to keep track of our work process and made mornings and afternoons briefs to stay aligned with the final objectives.

### Design
Our website design was made using Figma, click [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/1fpyLQdaZY3oKJFqO4uZoe/my.bocuse?node-id=11%3A6&scaling=scale-down) to view the prototype.

Here is an image of the database architecture.
